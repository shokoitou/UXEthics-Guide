# User Consent Framework

User consent is a cornerstone of our ethical design practices at Lael Corp. We believe that users have the right to make informed decisions about how their data is collected, used, and shared. Our user consent framework ensures that users are empowered with clear and understandable choices regarding their data.

## 1. Transparency in Data Collection

We provide users with comprehensive information about the data we collect, the purpose behind its collection, and the entities that will have access to it. Our interfaces communicate these details in an easily understandable format.

## 2. Granularity of Consent

Our consent framework offers users granular control over their data. Users can choose to provide consent for specific data points or functionalities, allowing them to make tailored decisions based on their preferences.

## 3. Unambiguous Language

We use clear and unambiguous language to explain the implications of data collection and usage. Technical jargon is avoided, ensuring that users fully understand what they are consenting to.

## 4. Opt-In Mechanism

We employ an opt-in mechanism for data collection. Users must actively provide consent before any data is collected, ensuring that their participation is voluntary and intentional.

## 5. Revocable Consent

Users have the right to revoke their consent at any time. We make it easy for users to withdraw their consent and provide clear instructions on how to do so.

## 6. Periodic Consent Renewal

We periodically ask users to review and renew their consent preferences. This helps ensure that users' preferences are up to date and reflect any changes in their circumstances.

## 7. No Pre-Ticked Boxes

We never pre-tick consent checkboxes or assume user consent. Users must make an affirmative action to indicate their consent.

## 8. Child Consent

For products targeted at children, we obtain parental or guardian consent before collecting any data from young users, adhering to relevant regulations like COPPA.

## 9. Continuous Education

We educate users about the importance of consent and data privacy. Our interfaces provide resources and links to learn more about the data we collect and how it's used.

## 10. Transparency in Updates

Any changes to our data collection practices are communicated transparently to users. Users are informed about changes in data usage and provided the opportunity to review and update their consent preferences.

By adhering to this user consent framework, we ensure that our users are informed, empowered, and in control of their data. Our design respects their choices and prioritizes their privacy throughout their interaction with our products.
